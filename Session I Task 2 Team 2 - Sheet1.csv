,,Discover Collectively Open Science Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/ to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhDieyf_WqGmcHvdfLIpKOXcVUPRO8M-H0PXfjszQWo/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,

",3,3,3,4,2,4,4,4,3,2,32,"A very interesting cross-continental project. It requires immense collaboration and precision! Additionally, I like the efforts to make it more layman friendly. ","The website provides a section dedicated for Press and Media in addition to scientific research. I wonder if this website could be more inclusive, and perhaps make findings accessible and understandable to other interested parties like school children and have science workshops to spark interest in kids"

,Kiron ,"That’s why we created Kiron Campus, an online learning platform for refugees worldwide and underserved communities in the Middle East",2,2,2,4,3,3,4,3,3,5,31,"The idea is great but can be improved in so many ways : 
Communication
Recognition by known institutions","It is not widely discoverable for the people in bad conditions and not being aware of these NGOs may never give them this chance to try it. Besides, the communication among those people are poor and somehow engineered (refugees and etc.) Therefore, there is a high need for a well developed communication channel for this purpose.

Also the documents needed are not so precise and the need of Internet can be a problem in a war zone : 

""A document that proves your status as a refugee, asylum seeker, internally displaced person, or belonging to another underserved community. If you don’t have an official document, download this one and let it be signed by a camp manager or an NGO representative"""
